## NMP debug experiments

* 4 cores
* 4MB per table

The rest of the configuration is exactly the same as the production experiments

We will debug:
* Partition-join
* Partition-non-join
* All probes

Partition experiments use a 4-core configuration while the other experiments use a 1-core configuration.
